Capo:

[D]  I fell as[Em]leep down [A7]by the str[D]eam,  And th[D]ere I [Em]had the str[A7]angest dr[D]eam
[G]   And down by Br[D]ennans [F#]Glen there [Bm]grows,   A [D]briar [A]and a [D]rose
   There's a [G]  tree in the fo[D]rest,   [G]    But I don't know w[D]here
[G]   I built a n[D]est out[Em] of your [A]hair,  And cl[D]imbing[A] up, In[D] to the[G] air
A b[D]riar a[A]nd a r[D]ose

[D]   I don't know h[Em]ow long [A7]it has b[D]een,   But [D]I was b[Em]orn in Br[A7]ennans G[D]len
[G]   And near the e[D]nd of sp[F#]ring there g[Bm]rows,   A b[D]riar [A]and a r[D]ose
   I [G] picked the r[D]ose one   ea[G]rly m[D]orn, [G] I pricked my fi[D]nger [Em]on a t[A7]horn
[D]   They'd grown so cl[A7]ose, Their win[D]ding w[G]ove,   The br[D]iar a[A]nd the r[D]ose

[D] I tried to t[Em]ear them b[A7]oth ap[D]art,
[D] I felt a b[Em]ullet [A7]in my he[D]art
[G] All dressed [D]up in sp[F#]ring's new cl[Bm]othes,
[D] The briar [A]and the r[D]ose
[G] And when I'm bu[D]ried, And [G]in my gr[D]ave,
[G] Tell me so [D]I may kn[Em]ow [A7]
[D] Your tears will f[A7]all, To m[D]ake love g[G]row,
[D] The briar [A]and the r[D]ose

[D] Your tears will f[A7]all, To m[D]ake love g[G]row,
[D] The briar [A]and the r[D]ose
