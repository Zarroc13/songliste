[Verse 1]

[G]It's amaz[D]ing how y[Cadd9]ou can speak [D]right to my [G]heart[D][Cadd9] [D]
[G]Without sa[D]ying a [Cadd9]word, you can l[D]ight up the [G]dark[D][Cadd9] [D]
[Cadd9]Try as I may, I can n[D]ever explain
[G]What I [D]hear when you [Cadd9]don't say a t[D]hing


[Chorus]

The s[G]mile on your f[D]ace lets me k[Cadd9]now that you n[D]eed me
There's a [G]truth in your e[D]yes saying y[Cadd9]ou'll never [D]leave me
The [G]touch of[D] your hand says you'll [Cadd9]catch me where ever I f[D]all
[Cadd9]You say it best,  [D]when you say nothing at [G]all[D][Cadd9] [D]


[Interlude]


[G] [D][C] [D]

[Verse 2]

[G]All day [D]long I can [Cadd9]hear people [D]talking out [G]loud[D][Cadd9] [D]
[Em]But when [Bm]you hold me [Cadd9]near, you [D]drown out the c[G]rowd[D][Cadd9] [D]
[Cadd9]Try as they may, they can [D]never define
[G]What's been sa[D]id between y[Cadd9]our heart and [D]mine


[Chorus]

The [G]smile on your f[D]ace lets me k[Cadd9]now that you n[D]eed me
There's a [G]truth in your e[D]yes saying y[Cadd9]ou'll never [D]leave me
The [G]touch of your h[D]and says you'll [Cadd9]catch me where ever I [D]fall]
[Cadd9]You say it best,  [D]when you say nothing at [G]all[D][Cadd9] [D]



[Chorus]

The [G]smile on your f[D]ace lets me k[Cadd9]now that you n[D]eed me
There's a [G]truth in your e[D]yes saying y[Cadd9]ou'll never leave me[D]

(softer)

The [G]touch of your h[D]and says you'll c[Cadd9]atch me where ever I [D]fall
[Cadd9]You say it best,  [D]when you say nothing at a[G]ll[D][Cadd9] [D]
