[Intro]

[C] [C][C][C]

[Verse 1]

I [C]did my best to [Em]notice when the[F] call came down the[C] line.
Up to the [G]platform of sur[Am]render I was[F] brought, but I was[G] kind.
And [C]sometimes I get [Em]nervous when I[F] see an open[Am] door.
Close your [F]eyes, clear your [F]heart.[G][G]


[Chorus 1]

Cut the [C]cord - are we [Em]human[F],  or are we[C] dancer?
[G]  My sign is [Am]vital[F],  my hands are[G] cold.
And I'm [C]on my [Em]knees looking for the[Am] answer.[Am]
Are we [Dm]human,[F]  or are we [C]dancer?[C]


[Fill]

[C]G   [Em]Am [F]F   [C]G


[Verse 2]

Pay my res[C]pects to grace and [Em]virtue, send my co[F]ndolences to[C] good.
Give my re[G]gards to soul and [Am]romance, they always[F] did the best they[G] could.
And [C]so long to de[Em]votion, you taught me[F] everything I[Am] know.
Wave good[F]bye, wish me [F]well.[G][G]


[Chorus 2]

You got to let me [C]go - are we [Em]human[F],  or are we[C] dancer?
[G]  My sign is [Am]vital[F],  my hands are[G] cold.
And I'm [C]on my [Em]knees, looking for the[Am] answer.[Am]
Are we [Dm]human,[F]  or are we [C]dancer?[Em]


[Middle Eight]

Will your [F]system be al[G]right, when you [G#dim]dream of home to[Am]night?
There [F]is no message [F]we're receiving, [G]let me know is your [G]heart still beating?


[Chorus 3]

[F]  Are we [G]human,[Am]  or are we d[Am]ancer?
[F]  My sign is [G]vital[Em],  my hands are [F]cold.
And I'm [C]on my k[Em]nees, looking for the[Am] answer.[Am]


[Instrumental]

[Chorus 4]
You got to let me [C]know - are we [Em]human[F],  or are we[C] dancer?
[G]  My sign is [Am]vital[F],  my hands are[G] cold.
And I'm [C]on my [Em]knees, looking for the[Am] answer.[Am]
Are we [Dm]human?[F][F]
Or are we [C]dancer?[C[Em]][F]
