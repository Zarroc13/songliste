Am Am G Dm  (x3)
F G Am


[Verse 1]

[Am]Take me down to the river bend
[Am]Take me down to the fighting end
[G]Wash the poison from off my skin
[Am]Show me how to be whole again
[Am]Fly me up on a silver wing
[Am]Past the black where the siren sing
[G]Warm me up in a nova's glow
[Am]And drop me down to the dream below


[Chorus]

Cause I'm [F]only a cr[C]ack in this [G]castle of[Am] glass
Hardly a[F]nything t[C]here for you to [G]see

[Am]Through the secrets that I have seen
[G]Wash the sorrow from off my skin
[Am]And show me how to be whole again


[Chorus]

Cause I'm [F]only a cr[C]ack in this [G]castle of[Am] glass
Hardly a[F]nything th[C]ere for you to [G]see
For you to s[Am]ee[[Am]Am][G][A[Dm]m][[Am]Am]

Hardly a[F]nything th[C]ere for you to [G]see
