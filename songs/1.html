      <pre>[Am]Now you all know,
[G]The bards and their songs.
[Em7]When hours have gone by,
[Am]I'll close my eyes.

[Am]In a world far away,
[G]We may meet again.
[Em7]But now hear my song,
[Am]About the dawn of the night.

[C]Let's sing the bards' song...

[Am]Far from home,
[Dm]No one will ever know our names,
[Am]But the bards' songs will re-
[F]main.

[Dm]Tomorrow will take it away,
[Am]The fear of today,
[Dm]It will be gone,
[Fm]Due to our magic songs.</pre>

      <pre>[Am]There's only one song,
[G]Left in my mind.
[Em7]Tales of a brave man,
[Am]Who lived far from here.

[Am]Now the bard songs are over,
[G]And it's time to leave.
[Em7]No one should ask you for the name of the one,
[Dm]Who tells the story.
