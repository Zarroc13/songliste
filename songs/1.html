[Am]Now you all know,
 [G]The bards and their songs.
 [Em7]When hours have gone by,
 [Am]I'll close my eyes.
[Am]In a world far away,
 [G]We may meet again.
 [Em7]But now hear my song,
 [Am]About the dawn of the night.
[C]Let's sing the bards' song..
 [G]
 [Am]
[Refrain]
 [Dm]Tomorrow will take us away,
 [Am]Far from home,
 [Dm]No one will ever know our names,
 [Am]But the bards' songs will re-
 [F]main.
 [G]
[Dm]Tomorrow will take it away,
 [Am]The fear of today,
 [Dm]It will be gone,
 [Fm]Due to our magic songs.
[Verse 2]
 [Am]There's only one song,
 [G]Left in my mind.
 [Em7]Tales of a brave man,
 [Am]Who lived far from here.
[Am]Now the bard songs are over,
 [G]And it's time to leave.
 [Em7]No one should ask you for the name of the one,
 [Dm]Who tells the story.
[C]
[G]
[Am]
[G]
[Refrain]
 [Dm]Tomorrow will take us away,
 [Am]Far from home,
 [Dm]No one will ever know our names,
 [F]But the bards' songs will re-
 [G]main.
[Dm]Tomorrow all will be known,
 [Am]And you're not alone,
 [Dm]So don't be afraid,
 [F]In the dark and cold,
 [G]'Cause the bards' songs will remai-ai-ain,
[C]They all will remain.
[Outro]
 [C]In my thoughts and in my dreams,
 [G/B]They're always in my mind,
 [Am]These songs of hobbits, dwarves and men,
 [C]And elves,
 [G/B]Come close your eyes..
[Csus2]You can see them, too..
 [G]
[Em]
