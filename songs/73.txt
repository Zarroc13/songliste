[Verse 1]
I took the s[C]upermarket flo[Em]wers from the window[F]sill
I threw the [C]day old te[Em]a from the cup[F]
[Am]   Packed up the p[G]hoto album [F]Matthew had made[C]
Memo[F]ries of a li[G]fe that’s been loved[C]
Page 1/3

Took the get[C] well soon ca[Em]rds and stuffed [F]animals
Poured the [C]old ginger be[Em]er down the sink[F]
[Am]   Dad always [G]told me don’t you [F]cry when you’re down[C]
But mum there’s a [F]tear every [G]time that I blink[C]


[Pre-Chorus 1]
[Dm]   Oh I’m in p[F]ieces, it’s tea[C]ring me up[G] but I know
[Dm]   A heart that’s [F]broke is a he[C]art that’s been loved[G]


[Chorus 1]
So I’ll sing [C]Hallelujah [Em][F]
You were an [G]angel in the [C]shape of my mum[Em]  [F]
When I fell [G]down you’d be there
[Am]Holding me up,[F] spread your wi[C]ngs as you go[G] 
And when G[Am]od takes you back,[F] he’ll say H[C]allelujah,[G] you’re home

[Verse 2]
I fluffed the pil[C]lows, made the b[Em]eds, stacked the chairs[F] up
Folded your [C]nightgowns ne[Em]atly in a case[F]
[G]  [Am]   John said he’d [G]drive then put his [F]hand on my cheek[C]
And wiped a [F]tear from the s[G]ide of my f[C]ace


[Pre-Chorus 2]
[Dm]   And I hope that [F]I see the w[C]orld as you did[G] cause I know
[Dm]   A life with [F]love is a li[C]fe that’s been lived[G]


[Chorus 2]
So I’ll sing [C]Hallelujah [Em][F]
You were an [G]angel in the [C]shape of my mum[[Em]F]

When I fell [G]down you’d be there
[Am]Holding me up,[F] spread your wi[C]ngs as you go[G] 
And when G[Am]od takes you back,[F] he’ll say H[C]allelujah,[G] you’re home


[Bridge]
[C]Ooh [Em]ooh [F]ooh
[C]Ooh [Em]ooh [F]ooh
[C]Ooh [Em]ooh [F]ooh
[Am]Ooh [G]ooh [F]ooh


[Chorus 3]



[C]Hallelujah [Em][Fadd9]
You were an angel in the [C]shape of my mum[[Em]Fadd9]
You got to see the person [Am]I have become,[F] spread your wi[C]ngs and I know[G] that when
G[Am]od took you back,[F] he said H[C]allelujah,[G] you’re home[C]
