[Verse 1]
[G]  When the rain is blowing [D]in your face

[Cm]  I could offer you a [G]warm embrace
[A7]  To make you [D7]feel my love[G]


[Verse 2]
[G]  When evening shadows and the [D]stars appear
[F]  And there is no one there to [C]dry your tears
[Cm]  I could hold you for a [G]million years
[A7]  To make you [D7]feel my love[G]


[Bridge 1]
[C]  I know you haven't made your [G]mind up yet
[B7]  But I would [C]never do you wr[G]ong
[C]  I've known it from the moment [G]that we met
[A7]No doubt in my mind where you be[D]long


[Verse 3]
[G]  I'd go hungry, I'd go [D]black and blue
[F]  I'd go crawling down the av[C]enue
[Cm]  No, there's nothing that I w[G]ouldn't do
[A7]  To make you [D7]feel my love[G]

[Bridge 2]
[C]  The storms are raging on the [G]rollin' sea
[B7]  And on the [C]highway of re[G]gret
[C]  The winds of change are blowing [G]wild and free
[Am7]You ain't seen nothing like me [D7]yet


[Outro]
[G]I could make you happy, make your [D]dreams come true
[F]  Nothing that I wou[C]ldn't do
[Cm]  Go to the ends of the [G]earth for you
[A7]  To make you [D7]feel my love[G]
[A7]  To make you [D7]feel my love[G]
