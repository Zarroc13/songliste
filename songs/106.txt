[Verse 1] (Arpeggio picking)
[E]You could be my [Am]unintended
[D]Choice to live my [G]life extended
[C]You could be the [B7]one I'll always [E]love
[E]You could be the [Am]one who listens
[D]To my deepest [G]inquisitions
[C]You could be the [B7]one I'll always [E]love

[Chorus]
[E]I'll be there, as [Am]soon as I can
[D]But I'm busy, [G]mending broken
[C]Pieces of, the [B7]life I had bef[E]ore

[Verse 2]
[E]First, there was the [Am]one who challenged
[D]All my dreams and [G]all my balance
[C]She could never [B7]be as good as y[E]ou
[E]You could be my [Am]unintended
[D]Choice to live my [G]life extended
[C]You should be the [B7]one I'll always l[E]ove
