[Verse]

[Am] Feelin' my [F]way through the [C]darkness
[Am] Guided [F]by a beating [C]heart 
[Am] I can't [F]tell where the [C]journey will end 
[Am] But I [F]know where to [C]start 
[Am] They tell me [F]I'm too [C]young to understand,
[Am] They say I'm [F]caught up in a [C]dream 
[Am] Well life will [F]pass me by if [C]I don't open up my eyes
[Am] Well that's [F]fine by [C]me


[Chorus]

So wake me [Am]up when [F]it's all [C]over 
[G]When I'm [Am]wiser [F]and I'm [C]older 
[E]All this [Am]time I was [F]finding my[C]self, And I 
[G]    [Am]  Didn't [F]know I was [C]lost
So [E]wake me [Am]up when [F]it's all [C]over 
[G]When I'm [Am]wiser [F]and I'm [C]older 
[E]All this [Am]time I was [F]finding my[C]self, And I 
[G]    [Am]  Didn't [F]know I was [C]lost

[Am]Na-n[F]a-n[C]a-na[C]-n[G]a... 
[Am]Na-n[F]a-n[C]a-na[C]-n[E]a... 


[Verse]

[Am] I tried [F]carrying the [C]weight of the world
[Am] But I [F]only have two [C]hands 
[Am] Hope I [F]get the chance to [C]travel the world
[Am] But I don't [F]have any [C]plans 
[Am] Wish that [F]I could stay for[C]ever this young
[Am] Not af[F]raid to close my [C]eyes 
[Am] Life's a [F]game made for [C]everyone 
[Am] And [F]love is the [C]prize
