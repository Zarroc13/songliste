CAPO 2

[Verse 1]

You [A]cut me down a [E]tree
And [D]brought it back to [A]me
And t[E]hat's what made me [D]see
Where I was going [A]wrong
You put me on a [E]shelf
And [D]kept me for your[A]self
I can [E]only blame m[D]yself
You can only blame [A]me


[Chorus]

And [D]I could write a [A]song
A [F#m]hundred miles [E]long
Well, [D]that's where I be[A]long
And [F#m]you belong to [E]me
And [D]I could write it [A]down
Or [F#m]spread it all a[E]round
Get [D]lost and then get [A]found
Or [F#m]swallowed in the [E]sea[A]

[Verse 2]

You [A]put me on a [E]line
And [D]hung me out to [A]dry
And [E]darling that's when[D] I
Decided to go to [A]see you
You cut me down to [E]size
And [D]opened up my [A]eyes
[E]Made me re[D]alize
What I could not [A]see


[Chorus]

And [D]I could write a [A]book
The [F#m]one they'll say that [E]shook
The [D]world, and then it [A]took
It [F#m]took it back from [E]me
And [D]I could write it [A]down
Or s[F#m]pread it all a[E]round
Get [D]lost and then get [A]found
And [F#m]you'll come back to [E]me
Not [D]swallowed in the [A]sea

[Chorus]

And [D]I could write a [A]song

Well, [D]that's where I be[A]long
Page 2/3
And [F#m]you belong with [E]me
The s[D]treets you're walking [A]on
A [F#m]thousand houses [E]long
Well, [D]that's where I be[A]long
And [F#m]you belong with [E]me
Oh what [D]good is it to [A]live
With [F#m]nothing left to [E]give
For[D]get but not for[A]give
Not [F#m]loving all you [E]see
Oh the s[D]treets you're walking [A]on
A [F#m]thousand houses [E]long
Well [D]that's where I be[A]long
And [F#m]you belong with [E]me
Not [D]swallowed in the [A]sea


[Outro]

[F#m]You belong with [E]me
Not [D]swallowed in the [A]sea
Yeah, [F#m]you belong with [E]me
Not [D]swallowed in the [A]sea
