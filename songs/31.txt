[Verse 1]

[G]Well how do you [Em]do, young [C]Willie [Am]McBride?
Do you [D]mind if I [D7]sit here down [C]by your grave[G]side?
And rest for a [Em]while 'neath the [C]warm summer [Am]sun,
I've been [D]walking all [D7]day and [C]I'm nearly [G]done.
[G]I see by your [Em]gravestone you were [C]only ninet[Am]een,
When you [D]joined the great [C]fallen in [G]19[D7]16,
I [G]hope you died [Em]well and I [Am]hope you died clean,
Or young [D]Willie Mc[D7]Bride, was it [C]slow and [G]obscene?


[Chorus 1]

[G]Did they [D]beat the drum [D7]slowly? Did they [C]play the fife [G]lowly?
Did they [D]sound the death [D7]march, as they [C]lowered you [D]down?
Did the [C]band play the Last Post and [G]chor[Em]us?
Did the [G]pipes play the [C]Flowers of the [D7]Fores[G]t?


[Verse 2]

[G]Did you leave er[Em]e a wife [C]or a sw[Am]eetheart behind?
In some[D] faithful [D7]heart is your [C]memory enshri[G]ned?
Although you di[Em]ed back in 1916,[C][Am]
Page 1/3
In that fa[D]ithful heart[D7] are you[C] forever ninetee[G]n?
[G]Or are you a s[Em]tranger without even[C] a na[Am]me?
Enclosed [D]in forever behind[C] a glass f[G]ra[D7]me,
In[G] an old photog[Em]raph all to[Am]rn battered and stained,
And faded[D] to yello[D7]w in a brown [C]leather f[G]rame.


[Chorus 2]

[G]Did they [D]beat the drum [D7]slowly, did they [C]play the fife [G]lowly?
Did they [D]sound the death [D7]march, as they [C]lowered you [D]down?
Did the [C]band play the Last Post and [G]chor[Em]us?
Did the [G]pipes play the [C]Flowers of the [D7]Fores[G]t?


[Verse 3]

[G]The sun now it s[Em]hines on [C]the gre[Am]en fields of France,
There's a wa[D]rm summer [D7]breeze that ma[C]kes the red p[G]oppies dance,
And look how th[Em]e sun shines fro[C]m under a cl[Am]oud,
There's no[D] gas, no bar[D7]bed wire[C], there's n[G]o gun firing now.
[G]But here in th[Em]is graveyard it's st[C]ill "[Am]No Man's Land",
The count[D]less white crosse[C]s stand mu[G]te[D7] in the sand,
To[G] man's blind i[Em]ndifference[Am] to his fellow man,
To a whol[D]e generat[D7]ion that were[C] butchere[G]d and damned.


[Chorus 3]

[G]Did they [D]beat the drum [D7]slowly? Did they [C]play the fife [G]lowly?
Did they [D]sound the death [D7]march, as they [C]lowered you [D]down?
Did the [C]band play the Last Post and [G]chor[Em]us?
Did the [G]pipes play the [C]Flowers of the [D7]Fores[G]t?

[Verse 4]

[G]Ah, young Willie[Em] McBride I can't [C]help wonder [Am]why,
Do t[D]hose that lie h[D7]ere know w[C]hy did they d[G]ie?
And did they be[Em]lieve when they [C]answered the[Am] call?
Did they r[D]eally believ[D7]e that this [C]war would end [G]wars?
[G]Well, the sorrow, the s[Em]uffering, the gl[C]ory, the [Am]pain,
The killi[D]ng and dying were[C] all done [G]in[D7] vain,
Fo[G]r young Willie[Em] McBride it[Am] all happened again,
And again[D], and aga[D7]in, and again[C], and aga[G]in.


[Chorus 4]

[G]Did they [D]beat the drum [D7]slowly? Did they [C]play the fife [G]lowly?
Did they [D]sound the death [D7]march, as they [C]lowered you [D]down?
Did the [C]band play the Last Post and [G]chor[Em]us?
Did the [G]pipes play the [C]Flowers of the [D7]Fores[G]t?

[G]Did they [D]beat the drum [D7]slowly? Did they [C]play the fife [G]lowly?
Did they [D]sound the death [D7]march, as they [C]lowered you [D]down?
Did the [C]band play the Last Post and [G]chor[Em]us?
And [G]did the pipes p[C]lay the Flowers[D7] of t[G]he Forest?
