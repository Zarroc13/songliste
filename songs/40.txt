[Chorus]
Well, you only need the [F]light when it's burning low[C]
Only miss the [G]sun when it starts to sn[Am]ow
Only know you l[F]ove her when you let her go[[C]G]
Page 1/4
Only know you've been [F]high when you're feeling low[C]
Only hate the [G]road when you're missin' ho[Am]me
Only know you l[F]ove her when you let her go[C]
[G]  And you let her go

Am F G
[Verse 1]
[Am]Staring at the bottom of your [F]glass
Hoping o[G]ne day you'll make a dream [Em]last
But dreams come sl[Am]ow and they go s[F]o fast[G]
You [Am]see her when you close your [F]eyes
Maybe [G]one day you'll understand [Em]why
Everything you [Am]touch surely d[F]ies[G]

[Chorus]
But you only need the [F]light when it's burning low[C]
Only miss the [G]sun when it starts to sn[Am]ow
Only know you l[F]ove her when you let her go[[C]G]
Only know you've been [F]high when you're feeling low[C]
Only hate the [G]road when you're missin' ho[Am]me
Only know you l[F]ove her when you let her go[[C]G]

[Verse 2]
[Am]Staring at the ceiling in the [F]dark
Same old [G]empty feeling in your [Em]heart
'Cause love comes sl[Am]ow and it goes s[F]o fast[G]
Well you [Am]see her when you fall as[F]leep
But never to [G]touch and never to [Em]keep
'Cause you loved her too [Am]much
And you dived to[F]o deep[G]

Only know you've been [F]high when you're feeling low[C]
Only hate the [G]road when you're missin' ho[Am]me
Only know you l[F]ove her when you let her g[C]o[G]

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low

Only hate the road when you're missin' home
