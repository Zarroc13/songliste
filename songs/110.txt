[Verse 1]
She [Em]hangs her head and cries on my [D]shi-[C]rt
She [D]must be [Em]hurt very [D]ba[G]dly
Tell [Gadd9]me    [G]what's [D]making you [Em]sad, [A]Li?
[Em]Open your [A]door, don't [D]hide in the [C]dark
You're [D]lost in the [Em]dark, you can [D]trust [G]me
'Cause [Gadd9]you   [G]know [D]that's how it [Em]must [A]be[[A/E]A]

[Chorus]
[Em]Lisa Li[A]sa, sad [B7]Lisa, Li[Em]sa


[Verse 2]
Her [Em]eyes like windows, tricklin' [D]ra[C]in
U[D]pon her [Em]pain getting [D]dee[G]per
Though [Gadd9]my    [G]love [D]wants to re[Em]lieve [A]her
She [Em]walks a[A]lone from [D]wall to [C]wall
[D]Lost in a [Em]hall, she can't [D]hear [G]me
Though [Gadd9]I     [G]know she [D]likes to be [Em]near [A]me[[A/E]A]


[Chorus]
[Em]Lisa Li[A]sa, sad [B7]Lisa, Li[Em]sa


[Verse 3]
She [Em]sits in a corner by the [D]do[C]or
There [D]must be [Em]more I can [D]tell [G]her
If [Gadd9]she   [G]really [D]wants me to [Em]help [A]her
I'll [Em]do what I [A]can to [D]show her the [C]way
And [D]maybe one [Em]day I will [D]free [G]her
Though [Gadd9]I     [G]know no [D]one can [Em]see [A]her[A/E][A]

[Chorus]
[Em]Lisa Li[A]sa, sad[B7] Lisa, Li[Em]sa
