[Intro]
N.C.
One, two

[Verse 1]
Page 1/3
[G] Stop the clocks, it's amazing
[Cadd9] You should see the way the light dances off your hair
[Dsus4] A million colours of h[Em7]azel, golden and [Cadd9]red
[G] Saturday morning is fading
[Cadd9] The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
[Dsus4]  My eyes are caught in your g[Em7]aze all over [Cadd9]again


[Pre-Chorus]
We were [Cadd9]love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Trying to f[G]ind ourselves in the [Dsus4]winter snow
So [Cadd9]alone in love like the world had disappe[G]ared[Dsus4]
Oh, I [Cadd9]won't be silent and I won't let go
I will h[G]old on tighter 'til the a[Dsus4]fterglow
And we'll [Cadd9]burn so bright 'til the darkness softly cl[G]ears[Dsus4]


[Chorus]
Oh, I will [Cadd9]hold on to the afterglo[G]w[Dsus4]
Oh, I will [Cadd9]hold on to the afterglo[G]w


[Verse 2]
[G] The weather outside's changing
[Cadd9] The leaves are buried under six inches of white
[Dsus4] The radio is pl[Em7]aying, Iron & [Cadd9]Wine
[G] This is a new dimension
[Cadd9] This is a level where we're losing track of time
[Dsus4] I'm holding nothing ag[Em7]ainst it, except you and [Cadd9]I


[Pre-Chorus]
We were [Cadd9]love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Trying to f[G]ind ourselves in the w[Dsus4]inter snow
So [Cadd9]alone in love like the world had disappe[G]ared[Dsus4]
Oh, I [Cadd9]won't be silent and I won't let go
I will [G]hold on tighter 'til the a[Dsus4]fterglow
And we'll [Cadd9]burn so bright 'til the darkness softly cl[G]ears[Dsus4]


[Chorus]
Oh, I will [Cadd9]hold on to the afterglow[G][Dsus4]
Oh, I will [Cadd9]hold on to the afterglow[G][Dsus4]
Cmaj7 N.C.
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
