3rd fret
[Verse 1]
Let [G]Italy boast of her gay gilded waters,
Her [C]vines and her [G]bowers and her [D]soft sunny skies.
Her [G]sons drinking love, from the eyes of her daughters,
Where [C]freedom [G]expires amid [D]softness and [G]sighs.

[Chorus]
[D]Scotland's blue mountains wild, where [G]hoary cliffs are piled,
[Em]Towering in [Bm]grandeur are [A]dearer tae [D]me.
[G]Land of the misty cloud, land of the tempest loud,
[C]Land of the [G]brave and proud,[D] land of the [G]free.

[Verse 2]
En[G]throned on the peak of her own highland mountains,
The [C]spirit of [G]Scotia reigns [D]fearless [A]and f[D]ree.
Her [G]green tartan waving o'er blue rock and fountain,
And [C]proudly she [G]sings, looking [D]over the [G]sea.

[Chorus 2]
[D]Here among my mountains wild, [G]I have serenely smiled,
When a[Em]rmies and e[Bm]mpires [A]against me were h[D]urled.
[G]Firm as my native rock I have withstood the shock,
Of [C]England, of [G]Denmark, of [D]Rome and the [G]world.

[Verse 3]
[A]But see how proudly her war steeds are prancing,
[D]Deep groves of [A]steel trodden [E]down in their path.
[A]The eyes of my sons like their bright swords are glancing,
[D]Triumphantly r[A]iding through [E]ruin and [A]death.

[Chorus 3]
[E]Bold hearts and nodding plumes [A]wave o'er their bloody tombs,
[F#m]Deepeyed in g[C#m]ore is the g[D]reen tartan's [E]wave.
[A]Shivering are the ranks of steel, dire is the horseman's wheel,
[D]Victorious in [A]battlefield [E]Scotland the [A]brave.

[E]Bold hearts and nodding plumes [A]wave o'er their bloody tombs,
[F#m]Deepeyed in g[C#m]ore is the g[D]reen tartan's [E]wave.
[A]Shivering are the ranks of steel, dire is the horseman's wheel,
[D]Victorious in [A]battlefield [E]Scotland the [A]brave.
