I've n[C]ever seen you looking so l[Am]ovely as you did ton[G]ight,
I've never seen you shine s[Am]o bright, m [G]m m [F]m.
I've n[C]ever seen so many men [Am]ask you if you wanted to d[G]ance,
They're looking for a little rom[Am]ance, given h[G]alf a ch[F]ance,
And I have n[Dm]ever seen that dress you're wearing,
Or the h[G]ighlights in your hair that catch your [Am]eyes,
I h[F]ave been bl[G]ind,

Chorus:
The lady in r[C]ed [Em]   [F]  is d[G]ancing with m[Am]e, [G] cheek to ch[Am]eek,
There's nobody h[F]ere,[G] it's just you and m[C]e,[Em]
It's where I want to b[C7]e,
But I hardly kn[F]ow [E]  this beauty by my s[Am]ide,[G][F]
I'll never forg[Dm]et [G]  the way you look ton[C]ight.[Am][G][G][Am[C]]

I've never seen you shine s[Am]o bright, you w[G]ere am[F]azing,
I've n[C]ever seen so many people w[Am]ant to be there by your s[G]ide,
And when you turned to me and sm[Am]iled, it took my breath aw[F]ay,
And I have n[Dm]ever had such a feeling,
Such a f[G]eeling of complete and utter l[Am]ove, as I d[F]o ton[G]ight,

Chorus:
The lady in r[C]ed [Em]   [F]  is d[G]ancing with m[Am]e, [G] cheek to ch[Am]eek,
There's nobody h[F]ere,[G] it's just you and m[C]e,[Em]
It's where I want to b[C7]e,
But I hardly kn[F]ow [E]  this beauty by my s[Am]ide,[G][F]
I'll never forg[Dm]et [G]  the way you look ton[C]ight.[Am][G]
I never will forg[Dm]et [G]  the way you look ton[C]ight.[Am]
The l[G]ady in r[C]ed, [Am] 
The l[G]ady in r[C]ed,[Am]
The l[G]ady in r[C]ed, [Am]
My l[G]ady in r[C]ed,

I love you
