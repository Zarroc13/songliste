Tuning:

no capo
[D]Out in the West Texas [Em]town of El Paso
[A7]I fell in love with a Mexican [D]girl.
[D]Nighttime would find me in [Em]Rosa's Cantina,
[A7]Music would play and Feleena would [D]whirl.

[D]Blacker than night were the [Em]eyes of Feleena,
[A7]Wicked and evil while casting a [D]spell.
[D]My love was deep for this [Em]Mexican maiden,
[A7]I was in love, but in vain I could [D]tell.[D7]

[G]One night a wild young cowboy came in,
[G]Wild as the West Texas [D]win[D7]d.
[D7]Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing,
With [D7]wicked Feleena, the girl that I [G]love.
So in [A7]anger

I [D]challenged his right for the [Em]love of this maiden;
[A7]Down went his hand for the gun that he [D]wore.
My [D]challenge was answered, in [Em]less than a heartbeat
The [A7]handsome young stranger lay dead on the [D]floor.

[D]Just for a moment I [Em]stood there in silence,
[A7]Shocked by the foul evil deed I had [D]done.
[D]Many thoughts raced through my [Em]mind as I stood there;
[A7]I had but one chance and that was to [D]run.[D7]

[G]Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran,
[G]Out where the horses were [D]tie[D7]d.
[D7]I caught a good one; it looked like it could run,
[D7]Up on its back and away I did [G]ride.
Just as [A7]fast as I

[D]could from the West Texas [Em]town of El Paso,
[A7]Out to the badlands of New Mexi[D]co.
[D]Back in El Paso my [Em]life would be worthless;
[A7]Everything's gone in life, nothing is [D]left.

[D]It's been so long since I've [Em]seen the young maiden,
[A7]My love is stronger than my fear of [D]death.[D7]

[G]I saddled up and away I did go,
[G]Riding alone in the [D]dar[D7]k.
[D7]Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me,
To[D7]night nothing's worse than this pain in my [G]heart.
And at [A7]last here

I [D]am on the hill over[Em]looking El Paso,
[A7]I can see Rosa's Cantina be[D]low.
[D]My love is strong and it [Em]pushes me onward,
[A7]Down off the hill to Feleena I [D]go.

[D]Off to my right I see [Em]five mounted cowboys,
[A7]Off to my left ride a dozen and [D]more.
[D]Shouting and shooting; I [Em]can't let them catch me,
[A7]I have to make it to Rosa's back [D]door.[D7]

[G]Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A [G]deep burning pain in my [D]sid[D7]e.
[D7]Though I am trying to stay in the saddle.
[D7]I'm getting weary, unable to [G]ride.
But my [A7]love for

Fe[D]leena is strong and I [Em]rise where I've fallen;
[A7]Though I am weary, I can't stop to [D]rest.
[D]I see the white puff of [Em]smoke from the rifle,
[A7]I feel the bullet go deep in my [D]chest.

[D]From out of nowhere, Fe[Em]leena has found me,
[A7]Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my [D]side.
[D]Cradled by two loving [Em]arms that I'll die for,
[A7]One little kiss and Feleena good[D]bye.
