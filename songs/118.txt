Well you're wa[Dm]lkin' through a city street, you co[F]uld be in P[C]eru
And you h[Dm]ear a distant calling and you k[C]now it's meant for y[Am]ou,
Then you d[Dm]rop what you were doing and you j[F]oin the merry m[C]ob,
And be[Dm]fore you know just where you are, you're [C]in an Irish [Dm]pub.


[Chorus]

They've got o[F]ne in Honolulu they've got one in Moscow too,
They got f[Dm]our of them in Sydney and a co[C]uple in Kath[Am]mandu.
So whe[Dm]ther you sing or pull a pint you'll al[F]ways have a j[C]ob,
'Cause wher[Dm]ever you go around the world you'll fin[C]d an Irish pu[Dm]b.


[Verse 2]

Now that des[Dm]ign is fairly simple and it usu[F]ally works the s[C]ame,
You'll have "[Dm]Razor Houghton" scoring in the [C]Ireland-England ga[Am]me
And you k[Dm]now your in an Irish pub the m[F]inute you're in the d[C]oor,
For a c[Dm]ouple of boys with bodhrans will be m[C]urdering Christy [Dm]Moore.


[Chorus]

'Cause wher[Dm]ever you go around the world you'll [C]find an Irish [Dm]pub.


[Verse 3]

Now the o[Dm]wner is Norwegian and the [F]manager comes from [C]Cork,
And the [Dm]lad that's holding up the bar says '[C]Only Eejits [Am]Work'
He was b[Dm]orn and bred in Bolton but his m[F]ammy's from Kil[C]dare,
And he's g[Dm]oing to make his fortune soon and m[C]ove to County C[Dm]lare.

'Cause wher[Dm]ever you go around the world you'll fin[C]d an Irish pu[Dm]b.

[Verse 4]

N[Dm]ow it's time for me to go I [F]have to catch me t[C]rain,
So I'll [Dm]leave ye sitting at the bar and f[C]ace the wind and r[Am]ain,
For I'll[Dm] have that pint you owe me, if I'm [F]not gone on the [C]dry,
When we [Dm]meet next week in Frankford in the f[C]ields of Athen[Dm]ry.


[Chorus]

'Cause wher[Dm]ever you go around the world you'll fin[C]d an Irish pu[Dm]b.


[Chorus 2]

'Cause wher[Dm]ever you go around the world you'll fin[C]d an Irish pu[Dm]b.
