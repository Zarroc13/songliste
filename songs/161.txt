[Verse 1]
The c[Em]astle is lit with c[Bm]andles and torches
The c[G]arriages of the nobles arrive in the [D]front
The s[Am]mell of spl[Bm]endor and d[C]ecadenc[D]e
And n[Em]obody can foresee[Bm]

The m[Em]asters and the mistresses are [Bm]walking trough the hall
They are sm[G]iling, laughing and sh[D]owing that they are tall
Th[Am]ey don't recog[Bm]nize that we're [C]waiting t[D]here
Em                 D*   Bm    (*not sure about this one)
And just nobody can foresee


Em (no chord here actually, but Em is okay)
This is the last night of the kings


[Chorus]
[Am]We are the [Em]folk and [Am]we have the [Em]right
To stand [Am]up and to fi[G]ght for an [C]independent [D]life
[Am]We are the f[Em]orce, we [Am]are the mi[Em]ght
And [Am]we will stand [G]up for an [C]independent [Em]life

[Verse 2]
The b[Em]all has begun and we're cl[Bm]osing our trap
Inw[G]ardly we're gathering our[D]selves
[Am]While the [Bm]dance comes t[C]o higher[D] pace
Still n[Em]obody can foresee[Bm]

Joini[Em]ng the circles, in black r[Bm]obes unknown
Unsh[G]eathing our swords and ge[D]t ready to dance
Our [Am]hearts are [Bm]filled with the w[C]ill to surv[D]ive
In the[Em] last night of their l[B7]ife

It's a m[G]urderous, [D]murderous ball [Em]night


[Chorus]
[Am]We are the [Em]folk and [Am]we have the [Em]right
To stand [Am]up and to fi[G]ght for an [C]independent [D]life

[Am]We are the f[Em]orce, we [Am]are the mi[Em]ght
And [Am]we will stand [G]up for an [C]independent [Em]life
