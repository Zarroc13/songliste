[Am]  The ashtray's full and I'm [Em]spillin' my guts
[Am]  She wants to know am I [Em]still a slut
I've got to [G]take it on the [A*]otherside

[Verse 4]
[Am]  Scarlet starlet and she's [Em]in my bed
[Am]  A candidate for a [Em]soul mate bled
[Am]  Push the trigger and [Em]pull the thread
I've got to [G]take it on the [A]otherside
[G]Take it on the [A]otherside
[G*]Take it on
[A*]Take it on
