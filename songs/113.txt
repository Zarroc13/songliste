And who are you, the proud lord said,
(Dm)    (Am)   (C)
that I must bow so low?
(F)    (C)      (F)      (C)
Only a cat of a different coat,
(Gm)     (DM)    (Am)
that's all the truth I know.


In a [Dm]coat of [Am]gold or a [Dm]coat of [Am]red,
a [Dm]lion [Am]still has [C]claws,
And [F]mine are [C]long and [F]sharp, my [C]lord,
as [Gm]long and [Am]sharp as [Dm]yours.


And [Dm]so he spoke, and [Am]so he spoke,
that [Dm]lord of Casta[Am]mere,
But n[Bb]ow the rains weep o[Gm]'er his hall,
with [Bb]no one [Am]there to h[Dm]ear.
Yes n[Bb]ow the rains weep [Gm]o'er his hall,
and [Bb]not a [Am]soul to [Dm]hear.
