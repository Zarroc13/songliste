Capo 2? 

[Verse 1]
Near to [Am]Banbridge town, in the [C]County [G]Down, one [C]morning [Am]in Jul[G]y
Down a [Am]boreen green came a [C]sweet colle[G]en and she [C]smiled as she [F]passed [G]me [Am]by
She [C]looked so neat from her [Dm]two white feet to the [C]sheen of her [Am]nut-brown [G]hair
Sure a [Am]coaxing elf, I'd to [C]shake mys[G]elf, to make [Am]sure I was [F]reall[G]y th[Am]ere

[Chorus]
From [C]Bantry Bay up to [Dm]Derry Quay and from [C]Galway to [Am]Dublin [G]town
No [Am]maid I've seen like the [C]brown Coll[G]een that I [Am]met in [F]Coun[G]ty [Am]Down

[Verse 2]
As she [Am]onward sped, sure I [C]shook my [G]head and I [C]gazed with a [Am]feeling [G]quare
And I s[Am]aid, says I to a p[C]asser-[G]by, who's the [C]maid with the [F]nut-[G]brown [Am]hair?
He s[C]miled at me and with [Dm]pride says he, that's the [C]gem of [Am]Irelands [G]crown
She's young [Am]Rosie McCann from the [C]banks of the [G]Bann, she's the [Am]star of the [F]Coun[G]ty D[Am]own 

[Chorus]
From [C]Bantry Bay up to [Dm]Derry Quay and from [C]Galway to [Am]Dublin [G]town
No [Am]maid I've seen like the [C]brown Coll[G]een that I [Am]met in [F]Coun[G]ty [Am]Down

[Verse 3]
She'd a [Am]soft brown eye and a [C]look so [G]sly and a [C]smile like the [Am]rose in [G]June
Page 1/2
And you [Am]held each note from her [C]lily-white [G]throat, as she [C]lilted an [F]Ir[G]ish [Am]tune
At the [C]pattern dance you [Dm]were in trance as she [C]tripped through a [Am]jig or [G]reel
When her [Am]eyes she'd roll, she would [C]lift your [G]soul as your [Am]heart she would [F]like[G]ly s[Am]teal

[Chorus]
From [C]Bantry Bay up to [Dm]Derry Quay and from [C]Galway to [Am]Dublin [G]town
No [Am]maid I've seen like the [C]brown Coll[G]een that I [Am]met in [F]Coun[G]ty [Am]Down

[Verse 4]
At the [Am]harvest fair she'll be [C]surely [G]there and I'll [C]dress my [Am]Sunday [G]clothes
With my [Am]shoes shon bright and my [C]hat cocked [G]right for a [C]smile from the [F]nut-[G]brown [Am]Rose
No [C]pipe I smoke, no [Dm]horse I'll yoke, let my [C]plough with the [Am]rust turn [G]brown
Till a [Am]smiling bride  by my [C]fires[G]ide sits the [Am]star of the [F]Coun[G]ty D[Am]own

[Chorus] x2
From [C]Bantry Bay up to [Dm]Derry Quay and from [C]Galway to [Am]Dublin [G]town
No [Am]maid I've seen like the [C]brown Coll[G]een that I [Am]met in [F]Coun[G]ty [Am]Down
