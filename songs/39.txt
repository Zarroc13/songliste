John Legend - All of Me

[Intro]
[Em] [D][[C]G]
[Verse]
[Em]What would I [C]do without your smart mo[G]uth
Drawing me i[D]n, and you kicking me [Em]out
Got my hea[C]d spinning, n[G]o kidding, I c[D]an't pin you [Em]down
What's going [C]on in that beautiful m[G]ind
I'm on your mag[D]ical mystery r[Em]ide
And I'm s[C]o dizzy, don't [G]know what hit me, but I'[D]ll be alr[Am]ight

[Pre-chorus]
My [Am]head's under w[G]ater
But [D]I'm breathing f[Am]ine
Y[Am]ou're crazy and [G]I'm out of my m[D]ind

[Chorus]
Cause a[G]ll of me

Loves a[Em]ll of you
Love your cu[Am]rves and all your edges
All your [C/D]perfect imp[D]erfections
Give your a[G]ll to me
I'll give my [Em]all to you
You're my [Am]end and my beginning
Even [C/D]when I lose I'm [D]winning
Cause I give you a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of m[G]e[D]
And you give me a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of y[G]ou, o[D]h

[Verse]
[Em]How many t[C]imes do I have to tell y[G]ou
Even when you're c[D]rying you're beautiful [Em]too
The world is b[C]eating you d[G]own, I'm ar[D]ound through every [Em]mood
You're my dow[C]nfall, you're my [G]muse
My worst dist[D]raction, my rhythm and bl[Em]ues
I can't stop sin[C]ging, it's rin[G]ging, in [D]my head for y[Am]ou

[Pre-chorus]
My [Am]head's under w[G]ater
But [D]I'm breathing f[Am]ine
Y[Am]ou're crazy and [G]I'm out of my m[D]ind

[Chorus]
Cause a[G]ll of me
Loves a[Em]ll of you
Love your cu[Am]rves and all your edges
All your p[C/D]erfect imp[D]erfections
Give your a[G]ll to me
I'll give my [Em]all to you
You're my [Am]end and my beginning

Cause I give you a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of m[G]e[D]
And you give me a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of y[G]ou, o[D]h

[Bridge]
Give me all of y[Am]ou, oh
[Am]Cards on the t[G]able
We're b[D]oth showing h[Am]earts
[Am]Risking it a[G]ll, though it's h[D]ard

[Chorus]
Cause a[G]ll of me
Loves a[Em]ll of you
Love your cu[Am]rves and all your edges
All your [C/D]perfect imp[D]erfections
Give your a[G]ll to me
I'll give my [Em]all to you
You're my [Am]end and my beginning
Even [C/D]when I lose I'm [D]winning
Cause I give you a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of m[G]e[D]
And you give me a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of y[G]ou[D]
Cause I give you [Em]all, [C]all of [G]me[D]
And you give me a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of y[G]ou, o[D]h
