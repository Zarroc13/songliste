[Verse 1]
[C]Have you seen the [G]old man in the [Am]closed-down [Em]market
[F]Kicking up the [C/G]paper with his [Dm/F]worn-out [G]shoes?
[C]In his eyes you [G]see no pride, [Am]and held loosely [Em]at his side
[F]  Yesterday's [C/G]paper telling [G7]yesterday's [C]news[C]

[Chorus]
So [F]how can you [Em]tell me you're [C]lo - [G/B]ne - [Am]ly[Am/G]
[D7/F#]  and say for you that the sun don't [G]shine[G7]?

[C]In our winter [G]city the rain [Am]cries a little [Em]pity
