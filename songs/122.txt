[Verse 1]

[G]All I want is [C]nothing [G]more
To hear you knocking [D]at my [Em]door
'Cause if [C]I could see your face once [G]more
I could [C]die a happy man I'm [G]sure

[G]When you said your [C]last good[G]bye
I died a little [D]bit in[Em]side
I [C]lay in tears in bed all [G]night
A[C]lone without you by my [G]side[D]


[Chorus]

But if you [Em]loved me
Why'd ya [C]leave me
Take my [G]body
Take my [D]body

All I [Em]want is
And all I [C]need is
To find some[G]body
I'll find some[D]body

Like [G]youuu, [C]ohhhh, [G]oh
[G]ohhhhh, [D]ohhhhh, [Em]oh
[C]youuuuuu[G]
Like [C]youuuuuu[G]


[Verse 2]

So [G]you brought out the [C]best of [G]me
A part of me I'd [D]never [Em]seen
You [C]took my soul and wiped it [G]clean
Our [C]love was made for movie [G]screens[D]


[Chorus]

But if you [Em]loved me
Why'd ya [C]leave me
Take my [G]body
Take my [D]body

All I [Em]want is
And all I [C]need is
