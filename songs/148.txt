[Intro]
[Em]Oooo[D]oo[G]oooooooo
[Em]Oooo[G]oo[C]oooooooo

[Em]Oooo[D]oo[G]oooooooo
[Em]Oooo[G]oo[C]oooooooo

[Verse]
[Em] I am not the [D]only [G]traveler
[Em] Who has not re[G]paid his [C]debt
I've been [Em]searching for a [D]trail to [G]follow again
Take me b[Em]ack to the [G]night we [C]met

And then [Em]I can [G]tell my[C]self
What the [Em]hell I'm su[G]pposed to [C]do
And then [Em]I can [G]tell my[C]self
Not to r[Em]ide a[G]long with [C]you

[Chorus]
I had [Em]all and then most of you, s[D]ome and now [G]none of you
Take me b[Em]ack to the [G]night we [C]met
I don't [Em]know what I'm supposed to do, [D]haunted by the [G]ghost of you
Oh, take me b[Em]ack to the [G]night we [C]met

[Verse]
When the n[Em]ight was [G]full of [C]terror
And your e[Em]yes were [G]filled with [C]tears
When you h[Em]ad not [G]touched me [C]yet
Oh, take me b[Em]ack to the [G]night we [C]met

[Chorus]
I had [Em]all and then most of you, s[D]ome and now [G]none of you
Take me b[Em]ack to the [G]night we [C]met
I don't [Em]know what I'm supposed to do, [D]haunted by the [G]ghost of you
Take me b[Em]ack to the [G]night we [C]met
