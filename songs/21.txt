[Verse 1]
[Am]I saw the light on the night that I passed by her [E7]window
[Am]I saw the flickering shadows of love on her [E7]blind
[A*]She [A7*]was my [Dm]woman
[Am]As she deceived me I [E7]watched, and went out of my [Am]mind[G7]

[Chorus]
[C]My, my, my, De[G]lilah
[G7]Why, why, why, De[C]lilah
[C]I could [C7]see that [F]girl was no good for [Dm]me
[C]But I was lost like a [G]slave that no man could [C]free[E7]

[Verse 2]
[Am]At break of day when that man drove away I was [E7]waiting
[Am]I crossed the street to her house and she opened the [E7]door
[A]She [A7]stood there [Dm]laughing
[Am]I felt the knife in my [E7]hand, a[C]nd she laughed no [Am]more[G7]

[Chorus]
[C]My, my, my, De[G]lilah
[G7]Why, why, why, De[C]lilah
[C]So be[C7]fore they [F]come to break down the [Dm]door
[C]Forgive me, Delilah, I [G]just couldn't take any [C]more[E7]

[Break]
Am E7
Am E7

[Verse Reprise]
[A]She [A7]stood there [Dm]laughing
[Am]I felt the knife in my [E7]hand, [C]and she laughed no [Am]more[G7]

[Chorus]
[C]My, my, my, De[G]lilah
[G7]Why, why, why, De[C]lilah
[C]So be[C7]fore they [F]come to break down the [Dm]door
[C]Forgive me, Delilah, I [G]just couldn't take any [C]more
[Am]Forgive me, Delilah, I [E7]just couldn't take any [Am]mo]ore
