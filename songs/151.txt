Capo 1 


&
[Verse 1]
Oh, [C]I bid farewell to the [F]port and the [C]land
And I [Am]paddle away from Brave [G]England's white sands
To [C]search for my long-ago [F]forgotten [C]friends
To [Am]search for the place I hear [G]all sailors [C]end


[Chorus 1]
As the [F]souls of the dead fill the space of my [C]mind
I'll [Am]search without sleeping 'til [G]peace I can find
I [F]fear not the weather, I [C]fear not the sea
I re[Am]member the fallen... do [G]they think of me?
When their [F]bones in the ocean, for[G]ever will [C]be


[Verse 2]
Plot a [C]course to the night, to a [F]place I once [C]knew
To a [Am]place where my hope died a[G]long with my crew
So I [C]swallow my grief and face [F]life's final [C]test
Page 1/3
T' find [Am]promise of peace and the [G]solace of [C]rest


[Chorus 2]
As the [F]souls of the dead fill the space of my [C]ears
Their [Am]laughter like children, their [G]beckoning cheers
My [F]heart longs to join them, sing [C]songs of the sea
I re[Am]member the fallen... do [G]they think of me?
When their [F]bones in the ocean, for[G]ever will [C]be


[Verse 3]
When at [C]last, before my ghostly [F]shipmates I [C]stand
I [Am]shed a small tear for my [G]home upon land
Though their [C]eyes speak of depths filled with [F]struggle and [C]strife
Their [Am]smiles below say I don't [G]owe them my [C]life


[Chorus 3]
As the [F]souls of the dead fill the space of my [C]eyes
And my [Am]boat listed over and [G]tried to capsize
I'm [F]this far from drowning, this [C]far from the sea
I re[Am]member the living... do [G]they think of me?
When my [F]bones in the ocean, [G]forever will [C]be


[Bridge]
Now that [C]I'm staring down at the [F]darkest a[C]byss
I'm not [Am]sure what I want, but I [G]don't think it's this
As [C]my comrades call to stand [F]fast and forge [C]on...
I make [Am]sail for the dawn until the [G]darkness has [C]gone


[Chorus 4]
As the [F]souls of the dead live fore'er in my [C]mind
Page 2/3
As I [Am]live all the years that they [G]left me behind
I'll [F]stay on the shore but still [C]gaze at the sea
I re[Am]member the fallen and [G]they think of me
For our [F]souls in the ocean, [G]together will [C]be


[Ending]
I re[Am]member the fallen and [G]they think of me...
For our [F]souls in the ocean, [G]together will [C]be
