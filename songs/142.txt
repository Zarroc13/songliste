CAPO 3?


[Intro]
C Am G F

[Verse 1]
[C]Oh, before they turn off all the [Am]lights
I won't read you your [G]wrongs or your [F]rights
The time has [C]gone
I'll [C]tell you goodnight, close the [Am]door
Tell you I [G]love you once [F]more
The time has [C]gone
So here it [G]is


[Chorus]
I'm not your [F]son, you're not my [G]father
We're just [C]two grown men [G/B]saying good[Am]bye
No [F]need to forgive, no [G]need to forget
I know [C]your mistakes [G/B]and you know [Am]mine
[F] And while you're sleeping,
I'll [G]try to make you proud
So [C]daddy, won't you [G/B]just close your [Am]eyes?
Don't be a[F]fraid, it's my [G]turn
To chase the monsters a[C]way


[Verse 2]
[C]Oh, well I'll read a story to [Am]you
Only difference is [G]this one is [F]true
The time has [C]gone
I [C]folded your clothes on the [Am]chair
Page 4/6
I hope you sleep [G]well, don't be [F]scared
The time has [C]gone
So here it [G]is


[Chorus]
I'm not your [F]son, you're not my [G]father
We're just [C]two grown men [G/B]saying good[Am]bye
No [F]need to forgive, no [G]need to forget
I know [C]your mistakes [G/B]and you know [Am]mine
[F] And while you're sleeping,
I'll [G]try to make you proud
So [C]daddy, won't you [G/B]just close your [Am]eyes?
Don't be a[F]fraid, it's my [G]turn
To chase the monsters away


[Bridge]
[C]Sleep a [G/B]lifetime
Yes, and [Am]breathe a [G]last word
You can [F]feel my [Am]hand on your [G]own
I will [C]be the [G/B]last one, so I'll [Am]leave a [G]light on
Let there [F]be no [Am]darkness in your [G]heart


[Outro]
I'm not your [F]son, you're not my [G]father
We're just [C]two grown men [G/B]saying good[Am]bye
No [F]need to forgive, no [G]need to forget
I know [C]your mistakes [G/B]and you know [Am]mine
[F] And while you're sleeping,
I'll [G]try to make you proud
So [C]daddy, won't you [G/B]just close your [Am]eyes?
