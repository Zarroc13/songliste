[Verse 1]
[Am]Roland [C]was [F]a warrior from the Land of the Midnight Sun
[F]With [C]a [G]Thompson gun for hire, fighting to be done
[Am]The [C]deal [F]was made in Denmark on a dark and stormy day
[F]So [C]he [G]set [Am]out for Biafra to join the bloody fray

[Am]Through [C]sixty-six [F]and seven they fought the Congo war
[F]With [C]their [G]fingers on their triggers, knee-deep in gore
[Am]For [C]days [F]and nights they battled the Bantu to their knees
[F]They [C]killed [G]to [Am]earn their living and to help out the Congolese

[Chorus]
[F]Roland [C]the [Dm]Thompson [Am]gunner...
[F]Roland [C]the [Dm]Thompson [Am]gunner...

[Verse 2]
[Am]His [C]comrades [F]fought beside him - Van Owen and the rest
[F]But [C]of [G]all the Thompson gunners Roland was the best
[Am]So [C]the [F]CIA decided they wanted Roland dead
[F]That [C]son-of-a-bitch [G]Van [Am]Owen blew off Roland's head

[Chorus]

[C]Roland [G]the  [F]headless Thompson  gunner
(Time, time, time,         for another peaceful war)
[C]Nor    [G]-    way's     bravest        son
(But time stands still for Roland 'til he evens up the score)

[Am]They [G]can [C]still [G]see [F]his [Am]headless body stalking through the night
[C]In [G]the [Am]muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun
[C]In [G]the [F]muzzle [F]flash [G]of [Am]Roland's Thompson gun

[Verse 3]
[Am]Roland [C]searched [F]the continent for the man who'd done him in
[F]He [C]found [G]him in Mombassa in a barroom drinking gin
[Am]Roland [C]aimed [F]his Thompson gun - he didn't say a word
[F]But [C]he [G]blew [Am]Van Owen's body from there to Johannesburg

[Chorus]
[F]Roland [C]the [Dm]headless [Am]Thompson gunner...
[F]Roland [C]the [Dm]headless [Am]Thompson gunner...
[F]Roland [C]the [Dm]headless [Am]Thompson gunner...(talkinâ€™ about the man)
[F]Roland [C]the [Dm]headless [Am]Thompson gunner...

[Verse 4]
[Am]The [C]eternal [F]Thompson gunner, still wandering through the night
[F]Now [C]it's [G]ten years later but he still keeps up the fight
[Am]In [C]Ireland, [F]in Lebanon, in Palestine and Berkeley...
[F]Patty [F]Hearst [F]heard [G]the burst of Roland's Thompson gun
[Am]And bought it
