[Verse 1]
How [A]long before I get [Em]in,
before it [Em]starts, before I be[D]gin?
How [A]long before you de[Em]cide,
before I [Em]know what it feels l[D]ike?
Where [A]to, where do I g[Em]o?
If you never [Em]try then you'll never kn[D]ow
How [A]long do I have to cl[Em]imb
up on the [Em]side of this mountain of m[D]ine?

[Verse 2]
Look [A]up, I look up at n[Em]ight
Page 1/3
Planets are [Em]moving at the speed of li[D]ght 
Climb [A]up, up in the tr[Em]ees 
Every chance that you [Em]get is a chance you s[D]eize
How [A]long am I gonna s[Em]tand
with my [Em]head stuck under the [D]sand?
I'll [A]start before I can st[Em]op
or before I [Em]see things the right way u[D]p

[Pre-Chorus]
[G]   All that n[A]oise, and all that s[Bm]ound
[G]   All those pl[A]aces I got f[Bm]ound

[Chorus]
And [G]birds go flying at the [Bm]speed of sound
to [D]show you how it all be[G]gan
[G]Birds came flying from the [Bm]underground
If you could [F#m]see it then you'd underst[G]and

[Verse 3]
I[A]deas that you'll never f[Em]ind
All the in[Em]ventors could never des[D]ign
The b[A]uildings that you put u[Em]p
Japan and [Em]China all lit u[D]p
A [A]sign that I couldn't r[Em]ead
Or a [Em]light that I couldn't s[D]ee
Some [A]things you have to bel[Em]ieve
but others are [Em]puzzles, puzzling m[D]e

[Pre-Chorus]
[G]   All that n[A]oise, and all that s[Bm]ound

[Chorus]
And [G]birds go flying at the [Bm]speed of sound
to [D]show you how it all be[G]gan
[G]Birds came flying from the [Bm]underground
If you could [F#m]see it then you'd underst[G]and
Oh, when you [F#m]see it then you'll underst[G]and

[Post-Chorus]
[D] 
[Bridge]
[G]  All those s[A]igns, I knew what they [Bm]meant
Some things you [E]can invent
[G]  Some get m[A]ade, and some get s[Bm]ent
Ooh-[E]ooh

[Chorus]
And [G]birds go flying at the [Bm]speed of sound
to [D]show you how it all be[G]gan
[G]Birds came flying from the [Bm]underground
If you could [F#m]see it then you'd underst[G]and
Oh, when you [F#m]see it then you'll unders[G]ta[Gadd]nd[Gm][G[G]6]
