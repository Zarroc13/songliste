[Verse 1]

I’ve got [C]one req[D]uest it’s[C] simple
Please don’t [A]let the[G] people[F] in
I am [C]nursing an in[F]tolerance for [G]social interaction

And I’m [C]looking[D] for the[C] answers
In the [A]shaking[G] of my[F] thumbs
In the [E]changing of the[F] seasons
In the [G]things I haven’t done


[Chorus]

We’re gonna [F]need a bigger [C]blanket
every[G]body’s getting cold
And I can’t[F] seem to find the sol[C]ution
And the[G] narrative is old

I don’t [C]want to [D]disa[C]ppoint you
Am I [G]singing out of [F]key?
Have I [C]done enough i[F]mpressing[G] since this same time last week?
Your [C]enjoyment is important, your [A]employment[G] even more[F] so
So get [G]up and [F]wash the [C]dishes, put your [G]face on, hit the [C]road


[Chorus]

We’re gonna [F]need a bigger [C]blanket
every[G]body’s getting cold
And I can’t[F] seem to find the sol[C]ution
And the[G] narrative is old

I don’t [F]want to disap[C]point you
Am I [G]singing out of key?
Have I[F] done enough i[C]mpressing
since [G]this same time last week?


[Chorus]

We’re gonna [F]need a bigger [C]blanket

And I can’t[F] seem to find the sol[C]ution
And the[G] narrative is old, [C]oh[D]..[C].
