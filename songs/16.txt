Memories consume like opening the wounds
I'm [C]picking me [G]apart a[Dsus2]gain
[Em]You [C]all [G]assume
I'm [Dsus2]safe here in my [Em]room
[C]Unless I try to [G]start a[D]gain

I [Em]don't want to [C]be the one [G]the battles always [D]choose
Cuz [Em]inside I [C]realize that [G]I'm the one con[D]fused
[Em]I don't know what's worth [C]fighting for
Or [G]why I have to [D]scream...
[Em]I don't know why I [C]instigate
And [G]say what I don't [D]mean...
[Em]I don't know how I [C]got this way
I [G]know it's not  all [D]right...
So I'm [C]breaking the [D]habit
I'm [C]breaking the [D]habit to[Em]night

[Em]Clutc[C]hing my [G]cure
I [Dsus2]tightly lock the [Em]door
I [C]try to catch my [G]breath a[Dsus2]gain
[Em]I  [C]hurt much [G]more than [Dsus2]any time [Em]before
I [C]have no options [G]left ag[D]ain
