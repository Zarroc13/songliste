[Intro]
Am Em Am Em Dm Em Am  Em**  Am*
 
[Verse 1]
[Em][Am]I'm sitting here in a boring room,
[Em][Am]It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon.
[Em][Am]I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
[Em][Am]I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you,
    Dm           Em              Am       Em**  Am*
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.
 
[Verse 2]
[Em][Am]I'm driving around - in my car,

[Em][Am]I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far.
[Em][Am]I'd like to change my point of view
[Em][Am]I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
    Dm           Em              Am       Em**  Am*
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.
 
[Chorus]
[G][C]I wonder how, I wonder why
[Em][Am]Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
[G7][C][G][F]And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
[G][C]I'm turning my head - up and down,
[Em][Am]I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
[G7][G][F#dim7][F]And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.
 
[Interlude]
Am  Am  Em  Em  Am  Am  Em  Em  Dm  Dm  Em  Em  Am    Em**  Am*
Dam     dadoudi....
 
[Verse 3]
[Em][Am]I'm sitting here, I miss the power.
[Em][Am]I'd like to go out, taking a shower,
[Em][Am]But there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
[Em][Am]I feel so tired, put myself into bed,
      Dm           Em              Am       Em**  Am*
Where nothing ever happens - and I wonder.
 
[Bridge]
[Am][E]Isolation - Is not good for me,
[E][C][G]Isolation - I don't want to sit on a lemon tree.
 
[Verse 4]
[Em][Am]I'm stepping around in a desert of joy
[Em][Am]Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy
    Dm              Em               Am       Em**  Am*
And everything will happen - and you wonder.
 
[Chorus]
[G][C]I wonder how, I wonder why
