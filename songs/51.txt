Am Em Am Em Dm Em Am  Em**  Am*
[Verse 1]
I'm [Am]sitting here in a [Em]boring room,
It's [Am]just another rainy Sunday [Em]afternoon.
I'm [Am]wasting my time, I got [Em]nothing to do.
I'm [Am]hanging around, I'm [Em]waiting for you,
But [Dm]nothing ever [Em]happens - and I [Am]wonder.[Em**][Am*]

[Verse 2]
I'm [Am]driving around - [Em]in my car,
I'm [Am]driving too fast, I'm [Em]driving too far.
I'd [Am]like to change my [Em]point of view
I [Am]feel so lonely, I'm [Em]waiting for you
But [Dm]nothing ever [Em]happens - and I [Am]wonder.[Em**][Am*]

[Chorus]
I [C]wonder how, I [G]wonder why
[Am]Yesterday you told me 'bout the [Em]blue blue sky
And [F]all that I can [G]see is just a yellow [C]lemon tree.[G7]
I'm [C]turning my head - [G]up and down,
I'm [Am]turning turning turning turning [Em]turning around
And [F]all that I can [G]see is just another [C]lemon tree.[G7]
[Interlude]
Am  Am  Em  Em  Am  Am  Em  Em  Dm  Dm  Em  Em  Am    Em**  Am*
Dam     dadoudi....

[Verse 3]
I'm [Am]sitting here, I [Em]miss the power.
I'd [Am]like to go out, tak[Em]ing a shower,
But [Am]there's a heavy cloud [Em]inside my head.
I [Am]feel so tired, put my[Em]self into bed,
Where [Dm]nothing ever [Em]happens - and I [Am]wonder.[Em**] [Am*]

[Bridge]
[E]Isolation - [Am]Is not good for me,
[G]Isolation - [C]I don't want to [E]sit on a lemon tree.

[Verse 4]
I'm [Am]stepping around in a [Em]desert of joy
[Am]Baby, anyhow I'll get [Em]another toy
And [Dm]everything will [Em]happen - and you [Am]wonder. [Em**][Am*]

[Chorus]
I [C]wonder how, I [G]wonder why

[Am]Yesterday you told me 'bout the [Em]blue blue sky
And [F]all that I can [G]see is just another [C]lemon tree.[G7]
I'm [C]turning my head - [G]up and down,
I'm [Am]turning turning turning turning [Em]turning around
And [F]all that I can [G]see is just another [C]lemon tree.[G7]

[Outro]
I [C]wonder how, I [G]wonder why
[Am]Yesterday you told me 'bout the [Em]blue blue sky
And [F]all that I can [G]see, and [F]all that I can [G]see,
And [F]all that I can [G]see is just a yellow [C]lemon tree.
