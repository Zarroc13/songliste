[Verse 1]

[Em]If the stars, fall [D]down on me,
[Am]And the sun, re[Em]fused to shine
[Em]Then may the shackles be [D]undone,
[Am]May all the old words [Em]cease to rhyme
[Em]If the sky, turned [D]into stone,
[Am]It would matter no[Em]t at all
[Em]For there is no heaven, [D]in the sky,
[Am]Hell does not wait, for our downfall

[Pre-Chorus]

[C]Let the voice of re[G]ason shine,
[Am]Let the pious vanish,[Em] for all time,
[C]God's face is hidden, [G]all unseen,
[Am]You can't ask him what[Em] it all means


[Chorus]

[C]He was never on y[G]our side,
[Am]God was never on [Em]your side,
[C]Let right or wrong al[G]one decide
[Am]God was never on your side.


[Verse 2]

[Em]See ten thousand m[D]inistries,
[Am]See the holy righ[Em]teous dogs
[Em]They claim to heal, but all [D]they do is steal,
[Am]Abuse your faith, [Em]cheat, and rob
[Em]If God is wise, wh[D]y is he still,
[Am]When these false prophets, [Em]call him friend
[Em]Why is he silent, [D]is he blind?
[Am]Are we abandoned, in the end?


[Pre-Chorus]

[C]Let the sword of r[G]eason shine,
[Am]Let us be free of [Em]prayer and shrine
[C]God's face is hidden, [G]turned away,
[Am]He never has a [Em]word to say

[Chorus]

[C]He was never on [G]your side,
[Am]God was never on [Em]your side
[C]Let right or wrong, [G]alone decide,
[Am]God was never on [Em]your side

[Em]No, No, No.


[Solo]



[Chorus]

[C]He was never on [G]your side,
[Am]God was never on [Em]your side
[C]Never! Never! [G]Never! Never!
[Am]Never on your side! Never on your side!
[C]God was never on [G]your side,
[Am]Never on your [Em]sideâ€¦
