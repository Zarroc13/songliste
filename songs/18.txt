Chords
[Am]C
[F]G
[Em][Verse 1]
[Am]'Bang' goes the big bang in the d[C]arkness and thunder.
[Am]Adam and Eve were [C]strands of bacteria.
[Am]Blind we crawled with the [C]birds and the bees,
[F]Few years on we climbed [G]down from the trees,

[Am]And were standin' in Africa, l[C]ookin' at the sky
[Am]Saying 'why we're here? What h[C]appens when we die? '
[Am]We used god as a word for the [C]things we can't see,
[F]Now put on some clothes and [G]let's wait for tv.

[Am]Well it doesn't take long 'till we're [C]painting caves,
[Am]Makin' some men kings [C]and other men slaves,
[Am]Sayin' God is our reason, G[C]od is our leader,
[F]God spoke to me and he [G]told me to kill ya. '

[Am]We spread like a virus to [C]every dark corner,
[Am]Greeks and romans are [C]layin' down borders.
[Am]The slaves and the soldiers, the [C]queens and the kings,
[F]Wherever they were, they [G]all used to sing:


[Chorus]
Page 1/3
[Am]Birth, [Em]death, w[F]eddings and w[C]ars,
[Am]That's [Em]all we a[F]re good f[C]or.
[Am]If all of [Em]the past was p[F]layed as a s[C]ong,
[Am]Then our lives [G]are a beat of the [C]drum.


[Verse 2]
[Am]Invading, enslaving, then t[C]rading the plunder,
[Am]Tobaco and opium, [C]tea leaves and sugar.
[Am]Empires built with the [C]bones of the slaughtered.
[F]A barrel of booze in r[G]eturn for your daughters and

[Am]Birth, [Em]death, [F]weddings and [C]wars,
[Am]Naissance, [Em]décès, [F]mariage et [C]guerre,
[Am]Above the same [Em]earth, b[F]eneath the sa[C]me stars,
[Am]You can't hide the [G]beast that we [C]are.

[Am]Well by the dark ages we're g[C]ettin' into guns,
[Am]Still fightin' over god and who's g[C]ot the right ones,
[Am]Still singin' and dancin', now we're [C]paintin' on canvas,
[F]Pasting the time with our s*[G]* and our violence.

[Am]The west gets rich and it s[C]trangles the earth,
[Am]Romeo and Juliet c[C]an't make it work.
[Am]Factories, A-Bombs and [C]Flying-Machines,
[F]Finally someone inv[G]ents the tv.


[Chorus]
And it's [Am]birth, [Em]death, [F]weddings and [C]wars,
[Am]Naissance, [Em]décès, [F]mariage et [C]guerre,
[Am]Above the same [Em]earth, b[F]eneath the sa[C]me stars,
Page 2/3
[Am]You can't hide the [G]beast that we [C]are.


[Verse 3]
[Am]Instead of hunting now w[C]e go to Tescos,
[Am]Instead of talking now w[C]e wear headphones,
[Am]Instead of mountains we're he[C]ading for mars,
[F]Instead of god we have c[G]redit cards.

[Am]And we're still here two thou[C]sand and somethin',
[Am]No peace, e[C]conomy is crashing,
[Am]Just singin' and dancin' and [C]looking at the sky, sayin'
[F]'Why are we here? What[G] happens when we die? '


[Chorus]
Singing b[Am]irth, d[Em]eath, w[F]eddings and w[C]ars,
[Am]That's [Em]all w[F]e're good f[C]or.
If [Am]all of the p[Em]ast was p[F]layed as a [C]song,
[Am]Then our lives [G]are a beat of the [F]drum,
[Am]Then our lives [G]are a beat of the [C]drum.
