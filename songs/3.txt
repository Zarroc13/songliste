Capo 4

[Verse 1]
It's empty in the [Am]valley of your [C]heart
The sun, it rises [Am]slowly as you [C]walk
Away from all the [Am]fears
And all the [C]faults you've [G]left [C]behind[[F]C]

The harvest left no [Am]food for you to [C]eat
You cannibal, you [Am]meat-eater, you [C]see
But I have seen the [Am]same
I know the [C]shame in [G]your [C]defeat[C][F]

[Chorus]
But [C]I will [F]hold on [C]hope
And [C]I won't [F]let you [C]choke
[F]On the noose [C]around your [G]neck

And [Am]I'll find [F]strength in [C]pain
And [Am]I will [F]change my [C]ways
[F]I'll know my [C]name as it's called [G]again

[Bridge]
[Am] [C[C]][[Am]F][[C]C][Am][G][C]
[Verse 2]
Cause I have [Am]other things to fill my [C]time
You take what is [Am]yours and I'll take [C]mine
Now let me at the [Am]truth
Which will [C]refresh my [G]broken [C]mind[C[F]]

So tie me to a [Am]post and block my [C]ears
I can see widows and o[Am]rphans through my [C]tears
I know my call despite my [Am]faults
And [C]despite my [G]growing [C]fears[C][F]

[Chorus]
But [C]I will [F]hold on [C]hope
And [C]I won't [F]let you [C]choke
[F]On the noose [C]around your [G]neck

And [Am]I'll find [F]strength in [C]pain
And [Am]I will [F]change my [C]ways
[F]I'll know my [C]name as it's called [G]again[C]

[Verse 3]
So come out of your [Am]cave walking on your [C]hands
And see the world [Am]hanging upside [C]down
You can understand [Am]dependence
When you [C]know the [G]maker's [C]smile[C][F]

So [C]make your [F]siren's [C]call
And [C]sing [F]all you [C]want
I [F]will not [C]hear what you [G]have to say

Cause [Am]I need [F]freedom [C]now
And[Am] I [F]need to know [C]how
To [F]live my [C]life as it's [G]meant to be

[Bridge]
[C] [[F]G][C][C][C][F[F]][C]
[Chorus]
an' [C]I will [F]hold on [C]hope
And [C]I won't [F]let you [C]choke
[F]On the noose [C]around your [G]neck

And [Am]I'll find [F]strength in [C]pain
And [Am]I will [F]change my [C]ways
[F]I'll know my [C]name as it's called [G]agaaaaaaaai[C]n.
