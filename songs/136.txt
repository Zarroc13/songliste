[Verse]
It takes a crane to build [Em]a crane
It takes two floors to [Am]make a story
It takes an egg to make a [C]hen
It takes a hen to make an [Cm]egg
There is no end to what I'm [G]saying[D]


It takes a thought to m[Em]ake a word
And it takes some words to [Am]make an action
It takes some work to make it [C]work
It takes some good to make it [Cm]hurt
It takes some bad for sat[G]isfaction[D]

[Chorus]
[Em]La la la la la la la[Am] life is wonderful
[D]Ah la la la la la la [G]life goes [D]full circle
[Em]Ah la la la la la la[Am] life is wonderful
[D]Al la la la la

[Interlude]

[Verse]
It takes a night to make [Em]it dawn
And it takes a day to make you [Am]yawn brother
And it takes some old to make you [C]young
It takes some cold to know the [Cm]sun
It takes the one to have[G] the other[D]

And it takes no time to fall in [Em]love
But it takes you years to [Am]know what love is
It takes some fears to make you [C]trust
It takes those tears to make it [Cm]rust
It takes the dust to have it [G]polished[D]

[Chorus]
[Em]La la la la la la la[Am] life is wonderful
[D]Ah la la la la la la [G]life goes [D]full circle
[Em]Ah la la la la la la[Am] life is wonderful
[D]Al la la la la

[Verse]
It takes some silence to make [Em]sound
It takes a loss before you [Am]found it
And it takes a road to go no[C]where
It takes a toll to make you [Cm]care
It takes a hole to make a [G]mountain[D]

[Chorus]
[Em]Ah la la la la la la[Am] life is wonderful
[D]Ah la la la la la la [G]life goes [D]full circle
[Em]Ha la la la la la[Am] life is wonderful
[D]Ha la la la la la [G]life is [D]meaningful
[Em]Ha la la la la la[Am] life is wonderful
[D] lala la a a
