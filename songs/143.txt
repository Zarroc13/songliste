[Intro]
[C] 
[Verse 1]
[C]Your mouth is a revolver firing bullets in the [Em]sky
[C]Your love is like a soldier, loyal till you [Em]die
[F]And I've been looking at the stars for a long, long [Am]time
I've been putting out fires all my [C]life
Everybody wants a flame, but they don't want to get [G]burnt
And [G]today is our turn

[Chorus]
[C]Days like these lead to, [Am]nights like this lead to [F]love like ours
You light the [Am]spark in my bonfire [G]heart
[C]People like us, we don't[Am] need that much

Just some[F]one that starts, starts the [Am]spark in our bonfire [G]hearts

[Verse 2]
[C]This world is getting colder, strangers passing [Em]by
[C]No one offers you a shoulder. No one looks you in the [Em]eye
[F]But I've been looking at you for a long, long [Am]time
Just trying to break through, trying to make you [C]mine
Everybody wants a flame, they don't want to get [G]burnt
Well [G]today is our turn

[Chorus]
[C]Days like these lead to,[Am] nights like this lead to[F] love like ours
You light the [Am]spark in my bonfire [G]heart
[C]People like us, we don't[Am] need that much
Just some[F]one that starts, starts the [Am]spark in our bonfire [G]hearts

[Interlude]
Hmm, our bonfire [F]hearts
Our bonfire [Am]hearts
Uh, our bonfire [C]hearts
You light the [G]spark
[C]People like us, we don't[Am] need that much
Just some[F]one that starts, starts the [Am]spark in our bonfire [G]hearts

[Chorus]
[C]Days like these lead to,[Am] nights like this lead to[F] love like ours
You light the [Am]spark in my bonfire [G]heart
[C]People like us, we don't[Am] need that much
Just some[F]one that starts, starts the [Am]spark in our bonfire [G]hearts

[Chorus]
[C]Days like these lead to,[Am] nights like this lead to[F] love like ours
You light the [Am]spark in my bonfire [G]heart
